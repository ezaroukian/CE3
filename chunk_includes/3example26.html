<p>
  Here, the rule is the same as before, but the diagram has changed. 
 </p>
 <p>
Again, to determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases where the 'if'-clause is true, then we check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
	The 'if'-clause is true when <span class='q'>P1=John</span>. (When <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> or <span class='q'>P1=Peter</span>, the 'if'-clause is false, since neither has the name <span class='q'John</span>)
	</li>
	<li>
	When <span class='q'>P1=John</span>, the 'then'-clause is true (i.e. John reads War and Peace).
	</li>
 </ul>
 
 

<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
