Rules can also contain <b>variables</b>.
</p>

<p>
This will be like in algebra, where you might have a variable x, which can be any number. 
Like in algebra, you might have to solve for the variable X, which could be any number.

   We will use the variable "<span class='q'>P1</span>" or "<span class='q'>P2</span>" to range over the people <span class='q'>John</span>, <span class='q'>Mary</span>, and <span class='q'>Peter</span>.
</p>
<p>
 We will use the variable "<span class='q'>B1</span>" or "<span class='q'>B2</span>" to range over the books <span class='q'>War and Peace</span>, <span class='q'>Middlemarch</span>, and <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Here the rule is "<span class='q'>if (the person P1 has as name John) then (the person P1 reads the book War and Peace).</span>"
 </p>
 <p>
 To determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases where the 'if'-clause is true, then we check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
	The 'if'-clause is true when <span class='q'>P1=John</span>. 
	</li>
	<li>
	When <span class='q'>P1=John</span>, the 'then'-clause is true (i.e. John reads War and Peace). &ndash; <i>The diagram is consistent with the rule</i>
	</li>
 </ul>
 
 

<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
