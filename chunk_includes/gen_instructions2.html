<div style="width: 40em;">
  <h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>
  In the example below, the rule states "the person Mary reads the book Moby-Dick." 
</p>
<p>
	In the diagram, we see an arrow connecting   Mary to Moby-Dick, indicating that she does indeed read this book. 
</p>
<p>
	We should therefore respond "Yes", the diagram is consistent with the rule.
