Rules can also contain <b>variables</b>.
</p>

<p>
This will be like in algebra, where you might have a variable x, which can be any number. 
Like in algebra, you might have to solve for the variable X, which could be any number.

<p>
   We will use the variable "<span class='q'>P1</span>" or "<span class='q'>P2</span>" to range over the people <span class='q'>John</span>, <span class='q'>Mary</span>, and <span class='q'>Peter</span>.
</p>
<p>
 We will use the variable "<span class='q'>B1</span>" or "<span class='q'>B2</span>" to range over the books <span class='q'>War and Peace</span>, <span class='q'>Middlemarch</span>, and <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Here the rule is "<span class='q'>if (the person P1 reads the book B1) then (the person P1 has as name Mary).</span>"
 </p>
<p>
	We can see that the only arrow connects <span class='q'>Mary</span> to <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>, so we need to consider the case where <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1 = Moby-Dick</span> (for all other combinations, the if-clause will be false, so the rule cannot be violated in these cases). 
<ol>
<li>
When <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1 = Moby-Dick</span>, the rule requires <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span>. &ndash; <i>Consistent.</i>
</li>
</ol>
</p>


 <p>
 Again, to determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases in the diagram where the 'if'-clause is true, then check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
	IF: The 'if'-clause is true when <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span> (<span class='q'>the person Mary reads the book Moby Dick.</span>)
	</li>
	<li>
	THEN: When <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span>, the 'then'-clause is true (<span class='q'>the person Mary has as name Mary.</span>)
	</li>
 </ul>

<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
