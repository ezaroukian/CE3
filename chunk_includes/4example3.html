  <h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>
Rules can also contain <b>variables</b>.
</p>
<p>
   We will use the variable "<span class='q'>P1</span>" or "<span class='q'>P2</span>" to range over the people <span class='q'>John</span>, <span class='q'>Mary</span>, and <span class='q'>Peter</span>.
</p>
<p>
 We will use the variable "<span class='q'>B1</span>" or "<span class='q'>B2</span>" to range over the books <span class='q'>War and Peace</span>, <span class='q'>Middlemarch<span>, and <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Here the rule is "<span class='q'>if (the person P1 reads the book B1) then (the person P1 has as name Mary).</span>"
 </p>
<p>
	We can see that the only arrow connects <span class='q'>Mary</span> to <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>, so we need to consider the case where <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1 = Moby-Dick</span>. 
<ol>
<li>
When <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1 = Moby-Dick</span>, the rule requires <span class='q'>P1 = Mary</span>. &ndash; <i>Consistent.</i>
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
