    Here the rule is unchanged, but the diagram is no longer consistent with it.
  </p>
<p>
It's still true that when <span class="q">P1 = Mary</span> and <span class="q">B1 = Moby-Dick</span>, <span class="q">P1</span> has the name Mary.

</p>
<p>
However, when <span class="q">P1 = John</span> and <span class="q">B1 = War and Peace</span>, P1 has the name John, not Mary. The diagram, therefore, is not consistent with the rule.
