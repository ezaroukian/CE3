		Here the rule is unchanged, but the diagram is no longer consistent with it.

	<p>
		It's still true that when <span class="q">P1 = Mary</span> and <span class="q">B1 = Moby-Dick</span>, <span class="q">P1</span> has the name <span class="q">Mary</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, when <span class="q">P1 = John</span> and <span class="q">B1 = War and Peace</span>, <span class="q">P1</span> has the name <span class="q">John</span>, not <span class="q">Mary</span>. The diagram, therefore, is not consistent with the rule.
