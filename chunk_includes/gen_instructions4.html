  <h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>
Rules can also contain variables.
</p>
<p>
   We will use the variable "P1" or "P2" to range over the people John, Mary, and Peter.
</p>
<p>
 We will use the variable "B1" or "B2" to range over the books War and Peace, Middlemarch, and Moby-Dick.
</p>
<p>
  Here the rule is "if (the person P1 reads the book B1) then (the person P1 has as name Mary)."
 </p>
<p>
	We can see that the only arrow connects Mary to Moby-Dick, so we need to consider the case when P1 = Mary and B1 = Moby-Dick. 
<ol>
<li>
When P1 = Mary and B1 = Moby-Dick, the rule requires P1 = Mary. -- Consistent!
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
